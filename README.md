# Line Tracking Automated Delivery System

This project describes a line following system capable of parcel delivery implemented on a Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller. The device is controlled through Bluetooth using MIT App Inventor custom UI involving 'auto' and 'manual' modes. Components used include DC motors, motor drivers, ultrasonic distance sensors, IR sensors, Bluetooth module, buzzer, batteries and servo motor.

Auto mode: 
Selecting 'auto' mode allows the user to choose 'point X' or 'point Y' as payload point, where the parcel is offloaded using platform tilt mechanism. 

Manual mode:
The 'manual' mode is usually selected for when the device goes off-track, and requires manual steering to bring back to the track.
